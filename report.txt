Approach and challenges faced:

I started web app with python2.7 in backend and frontend frame work was done with flask.
I have used dictionary in python to save car infomration instead of deploying a Database because Accessing infomration from Dictionary is quiet faster and i believe we dont have need for database as 
number of cars could be hardly be 100 practically and also it must run on a system which have minimum configuartions.
As i have used dictionary if suppose server fails then there would be a chance of loosing information/data stored. For this reason i made a log file and if at all there is server failure, restarting server 
would work as i have fecthed data from log file.
